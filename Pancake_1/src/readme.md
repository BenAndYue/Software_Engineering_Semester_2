The chef in our place is sloppy, and when he prepares a stack of pancakes they come
out all different sizes. Therefore, when I deliver them to a customer, on the way to the
table I rearrange them (so that the smallest winds up on top, and so on, down to the
largest at the bottom) by grabbing several from the top and flipping them over,
repeating this (varying the number I flip) as many times as necessary.

More context: The process is as follows, there is a chef who bakes pancakes and puts the
pancakes on a plate. The plate always contains minimum 1 pancake and maximum 25
pancakes. All the pancakes have different diameters, so no pancake have the same size.
Afterwards the plate goes to the assistant cook who sorts the pancakes by size: the smallest
pancake is on top and the largest pancake is at the bottom. The assistant cook is only
allowed to sort the pancakes by flipping the stack of pancakes using a spatula (any other
method comes at the expense of taste...)
